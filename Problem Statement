1. Write Python queries returning True or False for each of the following logical sentences. 

a. The student with ssn = 82 has taken the course “CS 530” (must be in Transcipts) 
b. A student named “John Smith” has taken the course “CS 530” (must be in Transcipts). 
c. All students named “John Smith” has taken the course “CS 530” (must be in Transcipts) 
d. The student with ssn = 82 has satisfied all prerequisites for each class she is enrolled in. 
e. Every student has satisfied all prerequisites each class she is enrolled in. 
f. Every student who majors in “CS” has satisfied all prerequisites for each class she is enrolled in. 
g. A student named “John Smith” is enrolled in a class for which he did satisfied all prerequisites. 
h. Some courses do not have prerequisites 
i. All classes offered this semester have prerequisites. 
j. Some students received only grades “A” or “B” in every course they have taken (must appear in Transcripts) 
k. All students currently enrolled in classes taught by professor Brodsky (i.e., the name is "Brodsky" in faculty), major in “CS” 
l. Some students who are currently enrolled in classes taught by professor Brodsky major in “CS” 

2. Write Python (comprehension) queries to express/compute each of the following sequences. Eliminate duplicates, and sort the answers (by ssn for students, by (dcode, cno) for courses, by class for classes). 

a. All students { ssn: ..., name: ..., major: ..., status: ...} who have taken the course “cs530” (must be in transcripts) 
b. All students { ssn: ..., name: ..., major: ..., status: ...} named “John” (i.e., name = "John" in student) who have taken the course “CS 530” (must be in transcripts) 
c. All students { ssn: ..., name: ..., major: ..., status: ...} who satisfied all prerequisites each class they are enrolled in.
d. All students { ssn: ..., name: ..., major: ..., status: ...} who are enrolled in a class for which they have not satisfied all its prerequisites. 
e. All students { ssn: ..., name: ..., major: ..., status: ...} named “John” who are enrolled in a class for which they have not satisfied all its prerequisites. 
f. All courses {dcode: …, cno: ….} that do not have prerequisites 
g. All courses {dcode: …, cno: ….} that do have some prerequisites 
h. All classes {class: ..., dcode: ..., cno: ..., instr: ...} offered this semester that have prerequisites. 
i. All students { ssn: ..., name: ..., major: ..., status: ...} who received only grades “A” or “B” in every course they have taken (must appear in Transcripts) 
j. All CS students { ssn: ..., name: ..., major: ..., status: ...} who are currently enrolled in a class taught by professor Brodsky (name = “Brodsky” in faculty).
