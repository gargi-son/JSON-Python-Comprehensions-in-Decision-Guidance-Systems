# JSON-Python-Comprehensions-in-Decision-Guidance-Systems


Assume a JSON database of the form as given in the collection “db1.json” (in the distributed folder cs787_ha1_python_comprehensions_fall2022_template under testDBs). The meaning of the stored info is self-explanatory. For the purpose of queries below, assume that the possible grades are A, B, C and F; and that to satisfy a prerequisite for a class/course means to have taken the prerequisite courses (in transcript) with the grade of B or better. You need to implement Boolean and Data queries given below. 

Instructions: 

- Download the folder cs787_ha1_python_comprehensions_fall2022_template 
- In the sub-folder solution_python_comprehensions duplicate the file queries_template.py into queries.py 
- Implement the queries in questions 1 and 2 below, by replacing placeholders in the template queries.py with correct Boolean expressions and Python comprehensions 
- In command line, make solution_python_comprehensions folder your current folder 
- Run python produce_answers.py which will generate answers.json 
- Run python report.py which will generate report.json 
- In report.json you can see how many correct queries you implemented out of the total number; which queries are correct; and whether each query generates correct answer for every test database db1, db2, … under the folder testDB 
- To debug, you can examine the generated file answers.json and compare it with the file correct_answers.json under the folder testDBs 
- Recommended IDE: Atom Studio. If you decide to use another IDE, make sure you have plug-ins for JSON handling (“prettify” it; collaps and extend it etc), and support for Python. You also need to have a working Python environment, version 3.8 or later.
